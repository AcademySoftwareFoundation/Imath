# Imath

<img align="right" src="/OpenEXR/doc/images/windowExample1.png">

Imath is a basic, light-weight, and efficient representation of 2D and
3D vectors and matrices and other simple but useful mathematical
objects, functions, and data types common in computer graphics
applications, including the “half” 16-bit floating-point type.

### About Imath

Imath is a part of the OpenEXR project.

OpenEXR is a project of the [Academy Software
Foundation](https://www.aswf.io).  The format and library were
originally developed by Industrial Light & Magic and first released
in 2003.  Weta Digital, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Sony Pictures
Imageworks, Pixar Animation Studios, DreamWorks, and other studios,
companies, and individuals have made contributions to the code base.

OpenEXR is included in the [VFX Reference
Platform](https://vfxplatform.com).
