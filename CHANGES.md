# Imath Release Notes

## Inherited History from OpenEXR
History dated before May 9th 2020 has been inherited from OpenEXR
This history has been filtered using the tool [git-filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo)

This tool can selectively remove unneeded history based on the directories to which commits have been made. For instance, it can remove all history from a given directory using the command:\

git filter-repo --path old_dir1/ --path old_dir2/ --invert-paths\

Or it can keep all history from certain paths using \

git filter-repo --path remaining_dir1/ --path remaining_dir2/
