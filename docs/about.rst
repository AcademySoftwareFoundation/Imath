Imath is maintained by the OpenEXR project, a part of the `Academy
Software Foundation <https://www.aswf.io>`_.  The library were
originally developed at Industrial Light & Magic and first released as
open source in 2003.

Read the origin story of OpenEXR and Imath, and the ``half`` 16-bit
float type, in particular, on the `ASWF Blog
<https://www.aswf.io/news/aswf-deep-dive-openexr-origin-story-part-1>`_.

Imath is Version 3 because it was previously distributed as a
component of OpenEXR v1 and v2.

OpenEXR and Imath is included in the `VFX Reference Platform <https://vfxplatform.com>`_.
