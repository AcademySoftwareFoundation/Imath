Introduction to Imath
#####################

Imath is a basic, light-weight, and efficient C++ representation of 2D
and 3D vectors and matrices and other simple but useful mathematical
objects, functions, and data types common in computer graphics
applications, including the ``half`` 16-bit floating-point type.

Imath also includes optional python bindings for all types and
functions, including optimized implementations of vector and matrix
arrays.

The Imath library emphasizes simplicity, ease of use, correctness and
verifiability, performance, and breadth of adoption. Imath is not
intended to be a comprehensive linear algebra or numerical analysis
package.
