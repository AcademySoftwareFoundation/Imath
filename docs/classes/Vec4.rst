####

The ``Vec4`` class template represents a 2D vector, with predefined
typedefs for vectors of type `short`, `int`, `float`, and `double`.

Example:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/Vec4.cpp
   :language: c++
              
.. doxygentypedef:: V4s

.. doxygentypedef:: V4i
                    
.. doxygentypedef:: V4f
                    
.. doxygentypedef:: V4d
