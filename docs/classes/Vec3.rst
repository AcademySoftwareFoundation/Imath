Vec3
####

The ``Vec3`` class template represents a 3D vector, with predefined
typedefs for vectors of type `short`, `int`, `float`, and `double`.

Example:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/Vec3.cpp
   :language: c++
              
.. doxygentypedef:: V3s

.. doxygentypedef:: V3i
                    
.. doxygentypedef:: V3f
                    
.. doxygentypedef:: V3d
                    
.. doxygenclass:: Imath::Vec3
